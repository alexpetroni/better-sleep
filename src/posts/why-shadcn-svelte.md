# The Rise of "Copy-Paste" UI

Traditional component libraries (MUI, Bootstrap) give you a black box. You import `<Button />` and hope the API supports your use case. If not, you're fighting `!important` wars in CSS.

## The Shadcn Approach

**shadcn-svelte** isn't a library. It's a collection of reusable components that you *copy and paste* into your apps.

### Benefits

1. **Full Control**: The code lives in *your* project. You can change anything.
2. **Tailwind CSS**: Styled with standard Tailwind classes.
3. **Accessibility**: Built on top of headless primitives (bits-ui) ensuring weird edge cases are handled.

## Getting Started

Is as simple as:

```bash
npx shadcn-svelte@latest init
npx shadcn-svelte@latest add button
```
